OpenTibiaBR - Canary is a free and open-source MMORPG server emulator written in C++. It is a fork of the [OTServBR-Global](https://github.com/opentibiabr/otservbr-global) project. To connect to the server and to take a stable experience, you can use [mehah's otclient](https://github.com/mehah/otclient)
or [tibia client](https://github.com/dudantas/tibia-client/releases/latest) and if you want to edit something, check
our [customized tools](https://docs.opentibiabr.com/opentibiabr/downloads/tools). If you want to edit the map, use our own [remere's map editor](https://github.com/opentibiabr/remeres-map-editor/).
