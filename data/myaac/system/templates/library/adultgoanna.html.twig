They have thick skin with camouflage that ranges from bands and stripes to speckles and circles. The skin colour changes as the creatures mature, with juveniles being blue and adult animals being bright red. Goannas lay eggs in a nest or burrow, but sometimes also inside termite mounds, which offers protection as well as incubation. Additionally, the termites provide a meal for the young as they hatch. Goanna eggs are a sought after meal for the human population of Kilmaresh. But as getting them is a dangerous task, they make a rather expensive menu. <br/><br/>Goannas are found throughout the steppes of Kilmaresh. They prey on insects, smaller lizards, snakes, birds, mammals and also humans if they have the chance to do so. But they are also eaters of carrion and thus attracted to rotting meat. There's a debate whether goannas are venomous or not. It is a fact that goanna bites cause incessant bleeding and many sages assume that this is because of toxin-producing glands in the lizards' mouth.</p> <p>Adult Goannas have 8300 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Adult Goannas yield 6650 experience points. They carry earth arrows, emerald bangles, envenomed arrows, goanna meats, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
