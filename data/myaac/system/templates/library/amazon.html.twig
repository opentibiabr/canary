They attack every intruder of their sphere vigorously and cut off the heads of their victims in order to keep them as some kind of trophies. They are not only quite strong in close combat but are also able to throw knives with deadly precision.</p>  <p>Amazons have 110 hitpoints. They are weak against death and physical damage. It takes 390 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Amazons yield 60 experience points. They carry brown breads, daggers, girlish hair decorations, gold coins, sabres, skulls and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
