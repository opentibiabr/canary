He lives deep in the swamps of Tibia and attacks every intruder of his sphere. Well-equipped, he is very strong in close combat and uses his spear for distance fighting.</p>  <p>Black Knights have 1800 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, fire and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Black Knights yield 1600 experience points. They carry brass legs, brown breads, gold coins, halberds, plate armors, ropes, spears, steel helmets, two handed swords and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
