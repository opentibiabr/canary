Heavily armored and incredibly strong, their only weakness seems to be their relative slowness. Still they are fast enough to catch up with a careless victim and everybody is well advised to avoid any closer encounter with those beasts. A lucky person sees them roaming the shores and can prepare for their attacks. The more unfortunate ones do not see them before it is too late. What is more, try to avoid meeting Blood Crabs underwater as they are much stronger when they can cavort in their favourite element.<br/>Blood Crabs seem to appear out of nothing when they quickly ascend from the depth of the sea. Sometimes they wait motionlessly for a victim to approach, a strategy which works quite well because their shells can easily be mistaken for stones. It is rumoured that from time to time the quara tame Blood Crabs and use them as watchdogs, but since none of them was ever seen in a raid, this rumour is not confirmed yet.</p>  <p>Blood Crabs have 290 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and ice damage. Moreover, they are strong against physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and fire damage. It takes 505 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Blood Crabs yield 160 experience points. They carry fish, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
