It is best described as a hideous conglomerate of bones and rotten flesh vaguely resembling a bull. Bonebeasts are often created by some unscrupulous lich, and they mindlessly obey their master's orders no matter what they are. More often than not, these orders include impaling one or more hapless victims on one of the Bonebeast's massive horns.</p>  <p>Bonebeasts have 515 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Bonebeasts yield 580 experience points. They carry bones, bony tails, gold coins, skulls and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
