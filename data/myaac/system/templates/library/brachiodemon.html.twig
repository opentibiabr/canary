After untold time in Zarganash only the most adaptive of these creatures survived, but not unscarred. Zarganash has changed then permanently, trapping them for all eternity and binding their essence to the realm itself. Their self-awareness became bound to the essence of the plane in a twisted way. Should their material form ever be destroyed a gruesome fate of eternal torment awaits their consciousness. Forever will they ride helplessly with the storms and currents of Zarganash to be grinded down and reconstructed constantly. A fact they are aware of all to well, which makes them fight for their lives even more fiercely and desperately. Though the inner torment that is prevalent in Zarganash has already took deep roots in their essence and inherently changed them, some of them might still half-heartedly do the biddings of their demonic masters but they do so only out of an attitude of resignation and habit that grows more and more distant over time. In truth for a long time they have already given in to the despair and atrophy that permeates the realm and unknowingly became agents of the powers behind the curtains of Zarganash. While most of them are unknowingly doing the bidding of the pale worm and spread its taint wherever they go, they still think of themselves as free beings and would actively fight the worm and its minions. The subtle strings that the worm and others use on them usually prevent them from coming anywhere near the true plots that are played out in Zarganash. How much resistance against the will of the pale worm a brachiodemon could muster varies probably highly from individual to individual but the worm will always win in the long run.</p> <p>Brachiodemons have 25000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against death and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Brachiodemons yield 15770 experience points. They carry crystal coins, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
