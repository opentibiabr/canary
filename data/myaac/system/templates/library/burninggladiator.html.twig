However, there came a time when a group of Fafnar's adherers became more and more influential and aggressive until this sect postulated the sole worship of Fafnar. This resulted in a religious war between the Fafnar followers and those who fought for the duality of the two sun gods. Ultimately, the war was ended by a major natural disaster that split off the eastern peninsula from the western part of the land mass. This was interpreted as a demonstration of divine wrath. It was rumoured that Suon had shattered the continent in his anger about the humans' misdeeds. From that day on, the old empire was in shambles and the worship of Fafnar is now forbidden in the new empire.<br/>But the cult of Fafnar still exists on Kilmaresh, albeit in secret. Her followers go to great lengths to strengthen Fafnar's influence and try to re-establish her worship. To achieve their goals they are not above using either infiltration or violence. The Burning Gladiators are a special part of the the Wild Sun's cult. They are fierce warriors who seek to enforce Fafnar's will with a vengeance. If necessary they also protect the Priestesses of the Wild Sun on their rather subtle missions.</p> <p>Burning Gladiators have 10000 hitpoints. They are strong against energy, fire and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Burning Gladiators yield 7350 experience points. They carry Fafnar symbols, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
