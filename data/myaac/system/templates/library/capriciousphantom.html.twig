The phantoms that gave in to arbitrariness of almost obscene proportions are known as capricious phantoms. Their very existence is a contradiction and their presence is a pain to reality itself. What might be seen as aimed attacks are just manifestations of their unnatural state. Especially the human mind that tries to make sense of the mockery their presence causes, tend to actually see behaviour patterns and actions of the capricious phantom that are not really happening, just to make some sense of the hurtful confrontation. In reality the capricious phantoms are not existent at all. The concept that is hard to grasp for the mortal mind is, that they are kind of a blind spot in reality. An occurrence probably only possible in the twisted realm of Zarganash. These non-entities and their perceived actions are just a trick the mind plays, to cope with that what can't be understood or observed. Of course the results of their presumed actions are very real, even if caused by something entirely different than observed. In the end it makes little difference for a victim of the capricious phantom. Whatever it is or not has to be dealt with or it will cause damage and destruction. Luckily the occurrence is susceptible to normal weaponry and responsive to spells. So for many travellers the nature of the phantom is a moot point, they handle it like any other hazard, since at long as it can be 'killed', it's good enough for most. </p> <p>Capricious Phantoms have 30000 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Capricious Phantoms yield 19360 experience points. They carry crystal coins, great spirit potions and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
