Her change in tactics and the more covert approach has led to the hiring of shady characters to reinforce the order. Cobra Scouts are a vital backbone of Scarlett's forces. While they are often used for small errands and basic reconnaissance missions, their true purpose is to act as an extension of Scarlett's reach. They are sent out to all corners of the known world and receive their orders directly from her. They are often the first and probably last glimpse of the complex Cobra network for an outsider to witness.</p> <p>Cobra Scouts have 8500 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralysed. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Cobra Scouts yield 7310 experience points. They carry cheesy figurines, cobra crests, earth arrows, opals, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
