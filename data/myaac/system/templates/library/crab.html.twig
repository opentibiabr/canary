In fact Crabs live on the beach or in the sea. Their natural armour is very thick and their pinchers are suited to crush shells. Obviously, Crabs are well prepared to defend themselves and they surely will if they feel threatened. Usually they try to scare away intruders from their territory, but they do not pursuit trespassers for long. The taste of their flesh is rather unusual but not bad, some call it even a delicacy.</p>  <p>Crabs have 55 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and fire damage. It takes 305 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Crabs yield 30 experience points. They carry crab pincers, fish and gold coins with them.</p>  </div></div>
