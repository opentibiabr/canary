Only recent events led to a contact that shed some light on these peculiar beings. There seem to be two distinctively different kinds of dream-born, that align themselves with either the winter or the summer. Though there are conflicting reports about that alignment, the current theory is that there are two rivaling courts exists though it's still possible that there is just one court that changes in accordance to the seasons. In the few recorded encounters, the dream-born claimed to live in realms that their god created with his dreams. Given their obvious kinship to the common elves it's of course far more likely that they are just descendants of elves that fled the godwars into some kind of pocket dimension. They usually shun outsiders and rarely leave their own realm at all. What little information could be gathered about them suggests a lifestyle akin that of the other elves, though they seem to lack a cast system and have a feudal oriented society. Due to their isolation they developed odd quirks like the overemphasising of seasons, that hints at a primitive, animistic world-view. It's still recommended to improve any contact and further the knowledge about them for the sake of science. All research of their behalves is hampered by what some kind of disease that drives them mad and violent. The dream-born claim that this is caused by 'nightmares' which may hint that a feverish episode is the precursor of this madness. Although this disease seemingly does not spread to other species, it is still recommended to keep these aggressive lunatics at distance. This behavior gives new credit to the old saying: If bitten by an elf, please see your doctor. <br/>The rearguard of the summer court were obviously formidable archers. Driven insane by what others of their kind call 'nightmares', these archers often forget to keep their distance, running screaming towards their targets while constantly shooting at them. Even with such erratical behaviour they should not be underestimated at all. Their arrows usually find their mark, even when not aimed at vital body parts and their disdain for accurate aiming leads to a greater frequency of shots in general. As much as they are driven by hate and anger, they seem to enjoy the blood and pain caused by their attacks. Sometimes when they kill a target they can be observed to be fascinated by the death they caused, pausing a moment in combat just to return to battle with renewed fervor.</p> <p>Crazed Summer Rearguards have 5300 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Crazed Summer Rearguards yield 4700 experience points. They carry heaven blossoms, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
