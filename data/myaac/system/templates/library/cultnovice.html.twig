Their inherent cowardice is somewhat compensated by first signs of fanaticism. Determined to protect their cult, they are capable but not too impressive opponents. What they lack in strength, they try to make up with quantity. Usually Novices of the Cult band together for a fight, often accompanied by a member of a higher rank whom they protect with their lives. Quite clueless about the true agendas and teachings of the cults, they are seen as disposable shock troops by their superiors.</p>  <p>Novices Of The Cult have 285 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death, energy, fire and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Novices Of The Cult yield 100 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
