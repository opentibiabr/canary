They even talk in a similar language. They live in holes where they prospect for gold and other metals. Be warned that they get very angry about adventurers entering their claim. They will slay every intruder using their incredible power.</p>  <p>Cyclopes have 260 hitpoints. They are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 490 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Cyclopes yield 150 experience points. They carry gold coins, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
