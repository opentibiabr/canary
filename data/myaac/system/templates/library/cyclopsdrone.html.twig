They are born physically different from their kin. The most prominent feature of a Cyclops Drone are its four muscular arms. They are stronger and more persistent than the ordinary cyclops, though they lack considerably on intelligence. They are usually calm, but their fellow cyclopes train and condition them in order to ensure that their passive attitude changes quickly when facing one of the 'lesser' races. Conditioned Cyclops Drones usually attack on sight. Fortunately, they hardly seem to understand what they are doing and therefore rarely use the full strength of their imposing arms. Still, the sheer force of a thoughtless blow can crush bones and break weapons and armour. Cyclops Drones are not numerous, and as they are also not much valued among the cyclops, they are usually found deep underground working under supervision of other cyclops.</p>  <p>Cyclops Drones have 325 hitpoints. They are strong against energy, holy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 525 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Cyclops Drones yield 200 experience points. They carry gold coins, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
