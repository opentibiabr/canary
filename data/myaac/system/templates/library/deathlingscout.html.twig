With their fish-like appearance but an upright walk, both share a lot of features. Their origin has not been sufficiently studied and they were a mere myth to the younger Njey. Until they appeared on various sites all over Tibia - even on the surface. They once walked the surface in times long past and inherited their will to conquer the world to their descendants. It is unclear how their reappearance on this world came to be. What is in fact clear is that they have similar goals as the younger deeplings yet they are deadlier and more aggressive than anything that crawled out of the sea before them.</p> <p>Deathling Scouts have 7200 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. Moreover, they are strong against death damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Deathling Scouts yield 6300 experience points. They carry crystalline arrows, deepling filets, deepling warts, deeptags, small emeralds, small enchanted sapphires, vortex bolts and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
