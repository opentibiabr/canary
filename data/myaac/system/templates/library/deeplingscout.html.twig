It is not known how old they are exactly or when the first Deepling Scouts emerged from the depths of Tibia's seas. There are no known records of these creatures so far and the first sightings were reported only recently. Usually inhabiting the very depths of the world, it seems their number grew significantly over the years and at some time, they started ascending. It is currently unknown when or why this ascent started. As of now, their origin is shrouded in mystery.</p>  <p>Deepling Scouts have 240 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Deepling Scouts yield 160 experience points. They carry gold coins, hunting spears and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
