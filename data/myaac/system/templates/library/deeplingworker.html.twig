Forging the weapons of their masters and delving deeper and deeper in the ice-cold stone of the deep, they are the backbone of the arising Deepling war machine. Before the great uprising, the tasks of the Deepling Workers consisted of tending to the spawn, raising the Deepling offspring and maintaining a constant supply of food. Members of the lower castes are suppressed by higher ranked Deeplings and forced to labour. This "constraint" is not to be taken literally, however, as each member knows its place in society and usually shows contentment with its fate.</p>  <p>Deepling Workers have 190 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Deepling Workers yield 130 experience points. They carry fish, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
