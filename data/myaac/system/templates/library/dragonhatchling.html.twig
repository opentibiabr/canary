The sharp teeth and the instinct of a born predator paired with an ever ravenous appetite make the little Dragon Hatchlings not only a threat for other races but also for their brood mates. Only the most vicious of the numerous Dragon Hatchlings reach adulthood. In their tireless pursuit for food, they know no fear nor restraint. Adventurers visiting a dragons lair are often faced by a whole pack of Dragon Hatchlings, swarming over him like famished locusts. To make matters worse, Dragon Hatchlings are hardly encountered without their parents being close. Lured by the cry of their brood, the enraged parents tend to enter the battlefield in the worst moment. Furious about the threat posed to their offspring, the elder dragons become even more formidable opponents. Of course, also the Dragon Hatchlings do not cease their own attacks as they hope to get to taste some delicious adventurer.</p>  <p>Dragon Hatchlings have 380 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dragon Hatchlings yield 185 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
