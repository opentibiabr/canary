Sometimes though, when very ancient and powerful dragon lords mate, a child is born with a fraction of its parents immense power. The body of such a Dragon Lord Hatchling is protected by red scales which already hint on its powerful destiny. The powers of a Dragon Lord Hatchling outclass those of any ordinary hatchling. So to speak born into the nobility of dragon kind, the Dragon Lord Hatchlings contain the worst traits any dragon hatchling could have. Although they are able to control their appetite in a better way than other hatchlings, they only use this self-restraint for cruel cat and mouse games they love to play with their soon-to-be food. And food can be almost everything that is or has been alive, even their own kind. Particularly, old and sick dragons, that did not leave early enough for the fabled dragon cemetery, often fall prey to their malicious offspring. As dragons are not willing to teach anything to their hatchlings, the youngsters have to become keen observers to pick up a few tricks and some magic from the older generation.</p>  <p>Dragon Lord Hatchlings have 750 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Dragon Lord Hatchlings yield 645 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
