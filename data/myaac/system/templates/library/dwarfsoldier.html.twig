They are quite strong fighters and know how to make use of the complex terrain very well. Due to their shortness they can use passages through the mountains where nobody can follow them and attack with their crossbows from hiding-places where nobody expects them.</p>  <p>Dwarf Soldiers have 135 hitpoints. They are strong against earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and fire damage. It takes 360 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Dwarf Soldiers yield 70 experience points. They carry bolts, gold coins, shovels, soldier helmets, white mushrooms and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
