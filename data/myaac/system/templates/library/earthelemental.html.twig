All the abuse and mistreatment of the earth caused an elemental subconsciousness to wake up and to send the powerful Earth Elementals to seek revenge on the living creatures. It is said that Earth Elementals form spontaneously, so to speak anywhere and not necessarily at a place where the earth has been defiled. The Earth Elementals seem mindless, guided only by some mystic field that spans the whole world according to the followers of Crunor. If an Earth Elemental is disconnected from this field, it becomes increasingly violent and destructive. It starts a rampage that eventually will lead to its own destruction. However, even the Earth Elementals that are connected to this field are by no means peaceful creatures. They follow a universal instinct that often leads to conflicts with living beings. The ultimate goal might be to bring some kind of universal balance; but to achieve this goal, much violence is used, relying on the enormous strength and resilience of the Earth Elementals.</p>  <p>Earth Elementals have 650 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and energy damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, holy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Earth Elementals yield 450 experience points. They carry blank runes, earth arrows, gold coins, lumps of earth, small stones and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
