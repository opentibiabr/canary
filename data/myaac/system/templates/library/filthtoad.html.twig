Of course you can also find a lot of frogs, snakes and toads in those areas - but none of them is as vicious as the Filth Toad. It is a creature attracted by extremely dirty waters and it is somewhat tougher than a normal toad. Filth Toads are generally very old and quite possibly they have already fought for their survival since several decades.</p>  <p>Filth Toads have 185 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Filth Toads yield 90 experience points. They carry fish, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
