Nobody knows where these beings came from. Just like the devils from the myths, they carry a pitchfork with them and one of their feet is that of a goat. But are they real devils? However, their pungent gaze makes the experienced traveller shaken and their fireballs are quite dangerous.</p>  <p>Fire Devils have 200 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. It takes 530 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Fire Devils yield 145 experience points. They carry blank runes, small pitchforks and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
