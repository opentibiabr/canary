They are smaller than wolves and unlike many canids, foxes are not always pack animals. Typically, they live in small family groups, but some are known to be solitary. They eat insects, small reptiles, birds, mice, eggs and berries.</p> <p>Foxes have 22 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 255 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p> <p>Foxes yield 15 experience points. They carry meat and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
