Once scented, it is not easy for a human being to escape them. Basically a ball of teeth, they have neither eyes nor ears, they are simply upon this world to feast. Their arch rivals are the equally fast and ferocious silencers. They usually avoid each other as both have strengths and weaknesses which would outmaneuvre one against the other. They share some kind of strange religion with their larger siblings, the guzzlemaws.</p>  <p>Frazzlemaws have 4100 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy, fire, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Frazzlemaws yield 3400 experience points. They carry banana skins, bones, brown crystal splinters, crystal rubbish, fish tails, fishbones, frazzle skins, frazzle tongues, gold coins, great health potions, great mana potions, pieces of iron, platinum coins, remains of a fish, skulls and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
