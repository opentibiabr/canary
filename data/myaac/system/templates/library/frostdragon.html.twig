Even though they are still young compared with other dragons, they carry a strong dragon heritage and the consumed particles fuelled their strength even more.<br/>Their arrogance does not allow them to be something less than other dragons and so their temper is even worse than that of their dragon cousins. The feeling to have to prove themselves all the time makes them reckless and aggressive and with that even more dangerous.<br/>Frost Dragons usually get along well with other dragons for a while. However, mixed communities often suffer from prejudices and lethal infights between the species. Though the mostly younger Frost Dragons often lack the refined magic abilities of their cousins, they are usually more powerful when it comes to physical abilities. Their newly gained control over the element ice easily makes up for their missing command of fire. They still possess a quite impressive resistance against fire from their dragonic heritage. Unlike other dragons, the Frost Dragons do not live alone or in small families. Instead they tend to form flocks of frightening sizes. Flocks of Frost Dragons usually inhabit spacious lairs and claim large territories as their hunting ground which they fiercely protect against other predators.</p>  <p>Frost Dragons have 1800 hitpoints. They are immune to earth, fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Frost Dragons yield 2100 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins, green mushrooms and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
