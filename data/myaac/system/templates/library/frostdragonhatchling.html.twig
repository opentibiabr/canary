Exposed to the harsh climate, the Frost Dragon Hatchlings are taught the hard way the well-known rule of survival of the fittest. Only the most resistant and healthiest survive the first months. The always hungry hatchlings compete for food and shelter. Moreover, elder dragons too pose a constant threat as they do not shrink from devouring their own offspring in times of need. Constantly in need to raise their status in the pecking order of their lairs, the Frost Dragon Hatchlings improve their skills and become probably more lethal opponents than the ordinary adult dragon might be. Only rarely they hunt in the wilderness; it is much more likely to encounter the hatchlings in their lairs, supporting their relatives in their fight against intruders who are foolish enough to set a foot in the frost dragons' territory. The hatchlings tend to attack rather swiftly and deadly as they have to see to it that they get their food and loot before somebody else of their kin steals the prey.</p>  <p>Frost Dragon Hatchlings have 800 hitpoints. They are immune to earth, fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. On the other hand, they are weak against energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Frost Dragon Hatchlings yield 745 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
