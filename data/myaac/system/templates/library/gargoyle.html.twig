In fact, a reward offered by the great wizard Cyrius the Half-Bald to those who could solve the mystery was never claimed. However, one or two interesting facts have been discovered. It is widely agreed today that Gargoyles prefer dark places,which is why they are typically found in dreary dungeons and other subterranean complexes. There they breed and hunt, using their uncanny ability to blend in with the stony surfaces of their lairs.</p>  <p>Gargoyles have 250 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against death and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Gargoyles yield 150 experience points. They carry gold coins, potatoes, small stones, stone wings and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
