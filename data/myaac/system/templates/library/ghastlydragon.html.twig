It seems the Ghastly Dragon is not a sub-race of the dragons but some sort of intended transformation. Sages assume that Ghastly Dragons are the failed result of a self-initiated transformation of some ancient dragon. While probably the original aim is to reach some state of transcendence, the failed outcome is a creature trapped between the spirit world and the mortal realm. The failed transformation often dangerously maddens the dragon creature. Even those who against all odds manage to retain their sanity have to cope with the knowledge that they turned in some, even in their own eyes, abominable creature instead in the intended ascended being. This leads to the fact that also the few sane specimens are usually not less aggressive and destructive than their mad fellows.<br/>Although the legends of the lizard folk also tell about some extremely wise and benevolent Ghastly Dragons, most of them that have been encountered are dangerous and powerful. The transformation of their bodies has changed their abilities significantly. They can draw upon immense powers and use them to wreak havoc on anyone foolish enough to disturb them in their eternal agony.</p>  <p>Ghastly Dragons have 7800 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy, holy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Ghastly Dragons yield 4600 experience points. They carry Zaoan halberds, dark armors, gold coins, great mana potions, great spirit potions, plate legs, platinum coins, rusty armors, small emeralds, soul orbs, terra boots, twin hooks, ultimate health potions, undead hearts and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
