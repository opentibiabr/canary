They are quite strong and extremely dangerous if they crop up in packs. Hiding in the darkness, they wait for incautious adventurers. They can heal themselves and suck life energy out of their opponents.</p>  <p>Ghouls have 100 hitpoints. They are immune to death damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. It takes 450 mana to summon or convince these creatures. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Ghouls yield 85 experience points. They carry gold coins, rotten pieces of cloth, worms and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
