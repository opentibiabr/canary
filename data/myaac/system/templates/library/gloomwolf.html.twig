On the one hand it is significantly bigger and stronger, on the other hand it has inky black fur and glowing red eyes. Because of its appearance and its unusual strength there are numerous tales about the gloom wolf not being an ordinary animal but rather a kind of dire wolf or even a spawn of shadow. Some tell that it emerges from black magic or that usual wolves are transformed to gloom wolves by wicked spells. Others claim that gloom wolves come into being at places where many wolf packs were killed as a kind of avenging shadow creatures, similar to ghosts. </p>  <p>Gloom Wolves have 200 hitpoints. They are strong against death and earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire, holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Gloom Wolves yield 70 experience points. They carry gold coins, ham, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
