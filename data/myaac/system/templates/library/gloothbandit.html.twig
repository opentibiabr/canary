As usual bandits they try to gain something of value for themselves, but they are also highly interested in new glooth-based inventions and weapons. Glooth Bandits are often in the possession of a wide variety of weapons, their armour has usually at least one glooth-based component. They set up their hideouts in secluded and often dangerous caves, tunnels and sewers. Involved in many illegal activities, they can be found in the service of all kind of persons that want some dirty work performed. Mostly though, the theft of new glooth weapons is their main purpose.</p>  <p>Glooth Bandits have 2600 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Glooth Bandits yield 2000 experience points. They carry gold coins, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
