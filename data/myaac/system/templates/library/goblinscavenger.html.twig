They are highly skilled in recycling almost any garbage into useful things. In the camps, older Goblin Scavengers sort out the loot the raiders and warriors get into their hands. The younger Goblin Scavengers are sent out into the wilderness to loot and plunder everything they can get. Usually they form parties that sneak about the lands of their enemies and try to get as much loot as possible. It is said that the loot bag, still very popular among modern adventurers, was an invention of Goblin Scavengers.<br/>When surrounded by enemies, they try to keep a distance and to attack from afar. Since Goblin Scavengers are usually seasoned scouts, they also possess some knowledge about the wilderness and plants. This enables them to poison their weapons with a moderate effect.<br/>You never know what kind of loot a Goblin Scavenger might dig up from his pockets. It can be everything from a rune to much more valuable items. Goblin Scavengers occur either alone on a mission as a scout, in small groups of two or three, or as a band consisting of up to two dozens.</p>  <p>Goblin Scavengers have 60 hitpoints. They are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 310 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Goblin Scavengers yield 37 experience points. They carry bones, daggers, fish, gold coins, leather helmets, small axes, small stones and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
