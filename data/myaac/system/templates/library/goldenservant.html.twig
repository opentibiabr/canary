Each of them had his own special field. One was a master of manipulating all kinds of ore with his bare mind, another was able to wield powerful energies, and again another would know how to use the strangest of substances in Tibia to his benefit. All of them combined their knowledge to create their own loyal servants. Several prototypes were made. Some constructed of metal, others of gold or even diamond but all of them were based on flesh and bone. The Golden Servant in particular could be considered as the master pattern. Most of the creatures the mages constructed afterwards were based on this specific design. Some of them were faulty from the start. It is said that one of the mages even used whole armies of servants to take care of his experiments.</p>  <p>Golden Servants have 550 hitpoints. They are immune to holy damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Golden Servants yield 450 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
