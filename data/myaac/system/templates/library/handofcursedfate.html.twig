It is sure though that its existence is fuelled by powerful demonic forces. Living or animated, it is a fast and powerful minion in the demonic ranks. Yet obviously lacking a head, the creature is quite cunning and loves dirty surprise attacks. It usually attacks with individual fingers, but it is also said that the Hand of Cursed Fate sometimes grasps an opponent to crush it in its powerful grip. Its greatest pleasure is to bring pain and despair to others. Above all it enjoys the suffering of creatures. The Hand of Cursed Fate is attracted by those whom it senses as doomed and takes greatest amusement in their demise. Therefore it is a powerful adversary, and it is no mockery when it is claimed that the Hand of Cursed Fate can pull some dirty tricks out of its sleeve.</p>  <p>Hands Of Cursed Fate have 7500 hitpoints. They are immune to death, earth, energy and fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. On the other hand, they are weak against holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Hands Of Cursed Fate yield 5000 experience points. They carry assassin stars, concentrated demonic blood, demonic essence, gold coins, great mana potions, mind stones, platinum coins, protection amulets, small sapphires, soul orbs, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
