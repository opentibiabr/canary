It is their nature to destroy, to kill and to devour. Though intelligent, it is rarely known of such an elemental to control their anger long enough to be reasoned with. Even though they are not truly allied with the demonic forces, their desire to fight and to destroy more often than not has put them into uneasy alliances of destruction. Sometimes demonic overlords even manage to cull the massive fire elementals into servitude. It is said that some truly powerful magicians also managed this feat. There are also ancient rumours of something that the massive fire elementals desire above anything else; a desire in them burning so hot that it even pales their hatred. With this as bargaining tool, in the past some creatures managed to enlist the help of these elementals. Others knew long-lost spells to bind the elemental forces to their will. Thus vast armies of fire elementals, lesser and great, marched in the battles of the god wars. Several places in the known world still bear the mark of their doing, even after all these centuries. For now, the threat of another such attack seems unlikely and no greater numbers of massive fire elementals in our world have yet been encountered. Gnomish intelligence reports, however, speak of fire elementals of all kinds in the service of the enigmatic rulers 'below'. If they are servants, allies or only attracted by the mayhem and heat attributed to the activities of 'those below', is up to speculation. All evidence suggests though that there are far more of them left in the world than was assumed for a long time.</p>  <p>Massive Fire Elementals have 1800 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Massive Fire Elementals yield 1400 experience points. They carry gold coins, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
