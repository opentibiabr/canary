Lacking the hard shells which protect older scarabs and moving rather slowly, they do not pose a too dangerous threat to a well armed warrior. However, in greater numbers they can bring down even a capable foe. Since they usually prefer to remain with their siblings, it is unfortunately not rare to encounter a pack of them at once.</p>  <p>Larvas have 70 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and ice damage. It takes 355 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Larvas yield 44 experience points. They carry gold coins and meat with them.</p>  </div></div>
