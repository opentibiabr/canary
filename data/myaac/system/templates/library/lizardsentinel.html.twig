Lizard Sentinels form a kind of temple guard rather than an army. Following the orders of Templars and snakecharmers, they work, fight and die for the welfare of the lizard race. Bred and raised for this purpose, only the Lizard Sentinels seem to have an almost steady supply for their troops whose strength lies in their numbers. They are rather distance than melee fighters and they try to shun close combat which seems to be a privilege of the Templars. If Lizard Sentinels are forced to fight eye to eye, they defend themselves almost reluctantly as if they were even in the face of death trying to avoid breaking any taboo.</p>  <p>Lizard Sentinels have 265 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 560 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Lizard Sentinels yield 110 experience points. They carry gold coins, spears and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
