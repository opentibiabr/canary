Little facts are known but some cave drawings indicate that the Mammoth race is quite old. The peaceableness of the Mammoths led nearly to their extinction in the past. The shamans tell stories that the greed of the humans almost made the great Mammoths herds vanish from the face of the isles. When only a few Mammoths were still alive, the great north wind Chyll looked into this matter and decided to intervene. He whispered something into the ears of the Mammoths and the great beasts learned a new secret. This secret was aggression. From this day on, the Mammoths fought back. They learned to defend themselves from the greed of man. Still, the Mammoths never again became as numerous as they had been in the past. The days of the great Mammoth herds, which were roaming the icy land, are gone forever. Nowadays, Mammoths are able to defend themselves and only the bravest hunter who faces a mammoth will survive to carry home the meat and pelt as his rightful treasure.</p>  <p>Mammoths have 320 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 500 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Mammoths yield 160 experience points. They carry gold coins, ham, meat and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
