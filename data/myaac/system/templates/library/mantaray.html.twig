They often roam the seas in groups of two or more. Usually they are peaceful inhabitants of the depths but beware of their poison - they certainly know how to defend themselves.</p>  <p>Manta Rays have 680 hitpoints. They are immune to earth and fire damage. Moreover, they are strong against ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Manta Rays yield 125 experience points. They carry gold coins with them.</p>  </div></div>
