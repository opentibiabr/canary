They possess amazing magical powers, and their prowess in battle is truly fearsome. However, their undeniable power as well as their race's natural tendency towards pride make them vulnerable to the temptations of vanity and arrogance. The Marid, being devout followers of the prophet Daraman's teachings, try to resist these temptations as well as they can, but it has happened before that a Marid strayed from the true path and succumbed to the corruption and the lowly desires that are hidden deep in the soul of every djinn. Beware of such fallen Marid, because they are no better than the Efreet, the Marids' green-skinned djinn cousins and arch-enemies.</p>  <p>Marid have 550 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy, fire and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Marid yield 410 experience points. They carry blueberries, gold coins, royal spears, strong mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
