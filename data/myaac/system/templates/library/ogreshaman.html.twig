They have a plump, corpulent body, chunky hands and feet and a small, seemingly neckless head. An average adult ogre stands over twelve feet tall, and his waist circumference is almost the half of his height. Most ogres are bald and only rarely have facial hair. They use wooden clubs as weapons, banded, studded or spiked with iron; but stone hatchets or fork-like weapons are also common. While missile combat with bows or crossbows is too difficult for them, they are good at throwing heavy things, particularly boulders. They mature more quickly than humans, reaching adulthood at the age of twelve.<br/><br/>Ogres live in tribes that inhabit the steppe and grassland of Krailos, for the most part dwelling in big leather tents or stone huts, though some ogre tribes still have nomadic tendencies. Leader of a tribe is usually the strongest male ogre. The chieftain is supported by an ogre-shaman. If the shaman is female, the two are often, but not necessarily, a couple. The chieftain is responsible for all decisions concerning the hunt and martial matters while the shaman is responsible for all affairs spiritual and social. <br/><br/>Although the ogres are a warlike, often brutal people, they are mostly interested in good food rather than in anything else. Ogres worship the Great Hunger, a kind of spirit being they believe will eat up the entire world if not fed regularly. Therefore they often perform rites of sacrifice (of food and of living creatures) to feed this entity.  <br/><br/>Wandering ogre shamans summon the power of the Great Hunger in self-defense or to catch prey for their rituals. Though still enormous in size, ogre shamans are no fighters as such and prefer to keep at a distance, sending out their minions to fend off unwanted acquaintances while they slink away.</p>  <p>Ogre Shamans have 800 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Ogre Shamans yield 625 experience points. They carry gold coins, ogre ear studs, ogre nose rings, shamanic talismans, skull fetishes, skulls, strong mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
