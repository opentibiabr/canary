They are quite clever and know how to arrange the different troops - warriors, berserkers, spearmen, and shamans - to form powerful squads. They themselves are quite strong fighters that use even throwing knives.</p>  <p>Orc Leaders have 450 hitpoints. They are immune to fire damage. Moreover, they are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 640 mana to summon or convince these creatures. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Orc Leaders yield 270 experience points. They carry brown mushrooms, fish, gold coins, orc leather, plate shields, throwing knives and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
