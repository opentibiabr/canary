Above all, the Panda is a bear and as such short-tempered and fast in its attacks. It is just as strong as other bears, and the only major difference to its conspecifics is its habitat. Panda bears that were caught and shipped to Thais died quickly and even though magic was used, no Panda survived more than a week away from its home. It is found most often in the southern regions of Tiquanda. Considering that they share their territory with the vile dworcs and other savage creatures, it is quite obvious that they are fierce fighters.</p>  <p>Pandas have 80 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 300 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Pandas yield 23 experience points. They carry bamboo sticks, ham and meat with them.</p>  </div></div>
