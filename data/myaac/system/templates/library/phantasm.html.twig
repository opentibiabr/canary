Abducted from their dreamers on the backs of nightmares, they are unpredictable allies of chaos. Obviously destructive, their complete and absolute madness makes it hard to control them. However, some of the demonlords enjoy their service since their essence is quite close to the souls of mortals that those demons cherish. Some Phantasms are not created by the deeds of demons, but break loose from their mad dreamers by happenings in the world of the mortals or due to things that cannot be understood by those of sane minds. All Phantasms are able to shift from the realm of dreams to the real world and back at will, although their mental disposition makes it rarely a conscious decision. Still their physical form is an illusion and intangible. Their state of existence grants them some ghostly powers that they use to affect minds. Only the most powerful and mad Phantasms exists for a longer time. Their energy constantly leaking away, most of them fade into nothingness after a while if they cannot substitute this energy by stolen life forces.</p>  <p>Phantasms have 3950 hitpoints. They are immune to death and physical damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against earth and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy, fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Phantasms yield 4400 experience points. They carry blank runes, demonic essence, gold coins, great mana potions, platinum coins, shadow herbs, small amethysts, small emeralds, small rubies, small topazes, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
