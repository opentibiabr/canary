The pirat bombadiers seem to have plenty of both of them. Couple this with a love for fire and explosions and you get the dangerous mixture of which the pirat bombardiers consist. Whenever there is any task that involves fire, destruction and chaos, the bombardiers are the rats to be sent. And they are not shy to volunteer, as after a string of deadly mishaps before the heydays of pirat-dom, they are not allowed to handle their explosives without permission. So whenever they are ordered to employ their deadly weapons, their whole destructive potential is unleashed with glee. It is said that their favourite diet is the very cheese the green powder mold is growing on and over time the oldest bombardiers become explosive on their own. This myth is yet to be verified since the usual bombardiers behaviour isn't suited for a long live and old age. In fact the life of a bombardier is usually short and fiery. Even without bombs the bombardiers are discernable by burn marks, ashed fur and smouldered whiskers. Even without explosives at hand this pirats have a penchant for everything that burns. The most sane and stable bombardiers are employed as cannoneers and enjoy a certain amount of status amongst the crews. Other bombardiers though look upon them with disdain and have only contempt for this 'tamed fire'. In their spare time many bombardiers become cooks, although the only dish they serve is commonly coal. <br/>To some of them it's the epitome of their destructive existence, to cause as much destruction as possible in their final act and leave the mortal world in a blaze of glory. In the end they really love the smell of green powder in the morning. </p> <p>Pirat Bombardiers have 2300 hitpoints. They are strong against energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Pirat Bombardiers yield 1700 experience points. They carry great mana potions and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
