These cowardly demons are constantly scheming and plotting to bring despair and diseases to the world of the mortals. They enjoy the painful torments their poisons and plagues inflict on other beings. They rely on a disgusting diet that consists of poisonous, morbid and corrosive fluids. Their main capability lies in the creating of poisons and plagues as well as to transform usually insubstantial things like despair, pain and agony into substantial tools and weapons. Although their physique makes them powerful fighters, their inherent cowardice prohibits them to rise in the ranks of demon kind. They tend to use others to do the dirty work and operate behind the scenes. More often though, they end up forced into the service of a more powerful creature. Still they are rarely seen in the realm of men. More often they stay in the realm of demons and supply their masters and servants alike with new weapons to spread poison and sickness.</p>  <p>Plaguesmiths have 8250 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Plaguesmiths yield 4500 experience points. They carry battle hammers, dirty capes, gold coins, great health potions, morning stars, mouldy cheeses, pieces of iron, soul orbs, steel shields, two handed swords and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
