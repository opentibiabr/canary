They usually hunt small animals, but with their poisonous bite they can even kill animals that are bigger than them. Therefore, and as they always crop up in packs, they are quite dangerous for badly equipped adventurers.</p>  <p>Poison Spiders have 26 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 270 mana to summon these creatures but they cannot be convinced.</p>  <p>Poison Spiders yield 22 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
