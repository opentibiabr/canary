People often underestimate them for their bloated bodies. However, their strength lies not in exotic body traits but in their dark minds. They are the priests and witchdoctors of the quara. Their legacy is the dark magic of their long extinct masters. Although their power is only a fraction of the power that once ruled the murky depths of the ocean, it is still enough to be more than a match for the unsuspecting adventurer. The only chance of a more balanced fight is to challenge them ashore where they are somewhat weaker than in their maritime habitat. They wield powerful curses with ease and they can combine their sinister powers for old, forbidden rituals that call upon darkness and doom to do their bidding.</p>  <p>Quara Hydromancers have 1100 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Quara Hydromancers yield 800 experience points. They carry gold coins, quara eyes and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
