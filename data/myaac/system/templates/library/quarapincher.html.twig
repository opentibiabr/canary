Seemingly unstoppable, they attack stoically without remorse or hesitation. It is rumoured that the grip of their pincers can break a good sword into pieces. Being aware of the facts that they are somewhat clumsy and rather simpleminded, gives one an advantage whenever fighting a Quara Pincher. Another chance to win a fight against them is to duel them ashore where they are much weaker than in water, their natural habitat. Quara Pinchers  are usually encountered along with other quara who probably serve as their superiors and leaders. In larger battles the Quara Pinchers fortify the positions of the troops and provide cover for the other quara while they move forward.</p>  <p>Quara Pinchers have 1800 hitpoints. They are immune to fire and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against earth and energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Quara Pinchers yield 1200 experience points. They carry gold coins, great health potions, platinum coins, quara pincers and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
