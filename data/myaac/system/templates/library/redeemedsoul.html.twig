Souls delivered in such a way are by all means thankful towards their liberator. Unlike the aggressive tainted souls, they are not only peaceable but even timid, wherefore they leave quickly and vanish shortly after their liberation.</p>  <p>Redeemed Souls have 250 hitpoints. They are immune to holy damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Redeemed Souls yield 0 experience points. They carry nothing with them.</p>  </div></div>
