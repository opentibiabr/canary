For a long time Sea Serpents were exiled into the world of fairy tales just like the bogeyman or the man in the cave. However, during the years of the serpents, it became shockingly clear that Sea Serpents are a horrible reality. For many years, hordes of Sea Serpents made the ship passage between Carlin and Svargrond impassable. Then, almost over night, they vanished as suddenly as they had appeared. Still, sightings of Sea Serpents are not uncommon nowadays. Sea Serpents are omnivores but prefer meat over seaweed and tang. They hunt seals, sharks, octopuses and small whales, and occasionally also quara. The quara are in a strange relationship with the Sea Serpents. Some of them worship single Sea Serpents like gods, while others organise large hunting parties to exterminate Sea Serpents that enter their territory.<br/>Normally, Sea Serpents are afraid of the strange ships humans tend to travel with. Some of them, however, seem to have overcome their fear. Those Sea Serpents attack ships with all their strength, and they are able to destroy even the biggest ships that cruise the seas. If they are able to wreck a whole ship, one can imagine what a single diver or swimmer has to expect from these beasts. While most Sea Serpents avoid the noisy big ships, a single human is always a welcome snack. Sea Serpents attack immediately, and only the fact that they are not used to meet with resistance might be an advantage of their victims.</p>  <p>Sea Serpents have 1950 hitpoints. They are immune to ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Sea Serpents yield 2300 experience points. They carry dragon ham, gold coins, platinum coins, sea serpent scales and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
