In ancient times, this creature, chosen by the gods, was a vital part of the lizard culture and the centre of numerous gruesome rituals. With the downfall of the lizard civilisation, the Serpent Spawn became more and more uncontrollable, and finally started to become a threat to the lizards themselves. As if their minds had been darkened by a madness that mirrored the turmoil in the lizard society, they made no difference between friend or foe and their lethal wrath struck both. By making the most holy places of the lizards inaccessible, they sealed the fate of the lizard civilisation during the apes' revolt.<br/>It is rumoured there are still species of the Serpent Spawn around. Still guarding the sacred places with eternal vigilance, they are waiting for their creator to rise again and to lead them once more to reign the jungle of Tiquanda on the god's behalf. Being servants of the serpent god, they are blessed with magic abilities and their serpent heritage grants them enormous physical strength and constitution.</p>  <p>Serpent Spawns have 3000 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Serpent Spawns yield 3050 experience points. They carry gold coins, green mushrooms, small sapphires, snake skins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
