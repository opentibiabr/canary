They rarely sleep, they focus solely on their prey once they have chosen a victim, and they have enough energy to pursue even the swiftest creatures as they swim fast and extremely efficiently. Beware if you ever encounter a sleeping shark, chances are it is awake and you are just the meal it is resting for.</p>  <p>Sharks have 1200 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, fire, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Sharks yield 700 experience points. They carry deepling scales, fish, gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
