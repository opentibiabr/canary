The very special way of digesting its prey leads to very unique products a hunter can obtain. The items of interest are little glass plates that arise in the so called process of glassification. They are coveted materials for craftsmanship.<br/>During their development, they go through various stages which ultimately manifest in specific habits and appearance.<br/><br/>The adolescent carnivor has already breeded a massive protective dorsum. So its name is spiky carnivor. Adventurers should avoid direct contact with this species, otherwise they might get poisened by its spikes. It is more threatening than its younger developmental stage. So they hit harder while also having a better defence.</p> <p>Spiky Carnivors have 2800 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Spiky Carnivors yield 1650 experience points. They carry dark armors, green glass plates, platinum coins and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
