The most often observed feature is the ability to use some kind of gooey spittle that can trap smaller opponents and that becomes hard and resilient when drying up. It is often used to repair hive structures on the fly or even to erect some structures such as barricades when used by larger groups of Spitters. Since it takes some time to harden, it is only annoying and disgusting for bigger opponents such as humans, for this reason this kind of spittle is rarely seen in combat. In battle, they rather use their corrosive spittle. The use of this kind of spittle outside of war is somewhat up to speculations. It seems possible that it is used to dissolve hive structures that are no longer needed. The dissolved structures can be devoured by several of the hive creatures and later be used as construction material again. Adventurers that made forays into the deeper hive observed a third use of the spittle which seems the most important for the hive. The Spitters are the main feeders of the larvae in the hive. This kind of spittle seems nutritious for the Hive Born. It is not only important for their growth but also determines what kind of creature the larvae will evolve into. Though it has been assumed that there are three entirely different strains of Spitters, several observations disproved this theory. The Spitters are able to shift the usage of their spittle with little effort. They can be encountered almost everywhere in the hive although most times, they are only found in the major structures. Only in times of war considerable numbers of Spitters are seen far away from the hive. They serve as distance fighters and therefore play an important role in the composition of the melee-heavy hive armies.</p>  <p>Spitters have 1500 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against death and fire damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Spitters yield 1100 experience points. They carry compound eyes, gold coins, platinum coins, spitter noses and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
