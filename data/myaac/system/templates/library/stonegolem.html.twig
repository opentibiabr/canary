All their limbs are out of stone, and they live on stones. They live in the dungeons of Edron, where they find their favourite food, granite with quartz. Normally, they are peaceful, but they can get very angry about adventurers trampling on their food and try to slay the intruder using their incredible power.</p>  <p>Stone Golems have 270 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, energy, fire and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against ice damage. It takes 590 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Stone Golems yield 160 experience points. They carry gold coins, small stones, sulphurous stones and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
