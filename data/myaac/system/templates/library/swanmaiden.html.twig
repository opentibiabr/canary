The magical item allowing this transformation is a swan feather cloak, a garment with swan feathers attached. If this cloak is taken from a swan maiden, she is stuck in the shape she had at the time of the theft. She will only be able to shapeshift again when she regains her cloak. On Feyrist it is always hard to tell whether a swan swimming on a lake is an ordinary animal or a swan maiden in her bird shape. Swan maidens protect the wilds of their secret realm from intruders and live in small flocks along secluded lakeshores. It is told that a swan maiden can transform a willing human or elven virgin into a swan maiden herself. Swan maidens emerge from mortals' dreams about flying.</p>  <p>Swan Maidens have 800 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Swan Maidens yield 700 experience points. They carry colourful snail shell, gold coins, wild flowers and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
