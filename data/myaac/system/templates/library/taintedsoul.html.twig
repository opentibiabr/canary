It haunts the bogs as a wraith or ghost light in search of peace and salvation. Such hapless souls may be captured and cursed by evil witches or warlocks, thus transforming into tainted souls that aggressively and enviously attack everything they encounter. There are tales though that it is possible to redeem even these tainted souls.</p>  <p>Tainted Souls have 250 hitpoints. They are immune to death damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Tainted Souls yield 0 experience points. They rarely carry items with them.</p>  </div></div>
