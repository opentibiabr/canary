Sadly their appetite extends to all other kind of organic substances, including livestock and sentient beings. Given the insatiable appetite of a Terramite colony, the potential for destruction caused by an unhindered population is extreme. Both, the orcs and the lizard people, consider the Terramites as delicacies.<br/>Usually the Terramites are content with the things they find in the underground but if the colony is starving, some scouts are sent out to look for more fertile areas. They consider each and everything they find in the earth as potential food, and the unlucky fellow that curiously explores one of their mounds, learns soon enough about their warlike welcome for any intruder.<br/>Unlike other insects, Terramites are generalists and lack the distinction between workers, warriors and queens. This makes it rather difficult to extinguish a colony. It is unknown what - instead of a queen - holds a colony together, but a Terramite colony seems to run effectively even without a leader.</p>  <p>Terramites have 365 hitpoints. They are strong against earth and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against energy and fire damage. It takes 505 mana to summon or convince these creatures. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Terramites yield 160 experience points. They carry gold coins, terramite legs and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
