It is disputed whether the Tortoise has learnt at last to defend itself or, as some members of the explorer's society claim, some kind of natural selection has set in that left only the meanest and most aggressive Tortoises. Be that as it may, nowadays the island Tortoises are quite capable to defend themselves. Heavy natural armor and a strong jaw make up for their slowness to some extent. Still their slowness is their major weakness and it is probably only a matter of time until humans rout them out in their last refuges on the isles.</p>  <p>Tortoises have 185 hitpoints. They are strong against earth, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire damage. It takes 445 mana to convince these creatures but they cannot be summoned.</p>  <p>Tortoises yield 90 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
