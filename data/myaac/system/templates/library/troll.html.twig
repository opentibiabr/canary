There they hunt animals and seek treasures over which they keep a jealous watch. They are weak and silly fighters, but as a squad they can become quite dangerous.</p>  <p>Trolls have 50 hitpoints. They are strong against energy and holy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death and earth damage. It takes 290 mana to summon or convince these creatures.</p>  <p>Trolls yield 20 experience points. They carry gold coins, hand axes, leather boots, leather helmets, meat, spears and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
