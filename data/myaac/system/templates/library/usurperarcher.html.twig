Their main goal being the fall of king Kesar, they are trying everything in their might to breach the old walls of the castle. Shamefully disregarding the very life and well-being of its inhabitants. The usurper archers are especially keen with the longbow and should not be underestimated even over the longest distances.</p> <p>Usurper Archers have 7300 hitpoints. They cannot be paralysed. Moreover, they are strong against fire, holy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against death damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p> <p>Usurper Archers yield 6800 experience points. They carry broken longbows, meat, platinum coins, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p> </div></div>
