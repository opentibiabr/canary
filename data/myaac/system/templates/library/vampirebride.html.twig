While lesser vampires have often been turned by the spread of the curse, Vampire Brides were bitten almost exclusively by master vampires. At their lifetime, they have been women of extraordinary beauty who often had a strain of cruelty in their personality. As undead, they are powerful vampires of a haunting beauty that own a respectable array of abilities. They love to play cat and mouse with their chosen victim, and are rather picky in their choice whose blood they are going to drink. Also those that are not worthy as a blood donor are not safe from death, though. Quite the opposite, Vampire Brides love to cruelly torture their victims to death.<br/>Their cleverness makes many of them good magicians and alchemists. Some use magic or alchemy to look like a human and so make it easier to lay hands on their victims. They are vain creatures who love to surround themselves with small courts of undead in catacombs or under cities. It can take centuries before a Vampire Bride and its ghostly court are routed out by vampire hunters or the inquisition. Even then, the shrewd brides are often able to escape, ready to plan a horrible revenge.</p>  <p>Vampire Brides have 1200 hitpoints. They are immune to death damage. Moreover, they are strong against earth, energy and ice damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Vampire Brides yield 1050 experience points. They carry gold coins, platinum coins, strong mana potions, vampire teeth and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
