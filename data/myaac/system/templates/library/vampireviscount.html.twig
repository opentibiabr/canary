Viscounts can be charming in a casual way, but only to distract their prey until the final bite - they say it sours the flavour when their meal is scared or distressed. Masters of the rapier, they love to see their enemy bleed, heightening the pleasant anticipation of the kill while simultaneously letting their victim believe it could still win the fight. When hurt or when trying to impress his foe, the Viscount will eventually change form to scare his opponent away, and take on the shape of a vicious manbat.</p>  <p>Vampire Viscounts have 1200 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Vampire Viscounts yield 800 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
