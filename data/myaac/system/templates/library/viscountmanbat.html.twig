It is assumed by some of the wise in Tibia that the manbats are degenerated vampire viscounts unable to change back, or maybe some hellish breed between vampires and bats from a dark unnamed place. In appearance a more than man-tall giant blue bat with sharp claws and teeth, the manbat is both intimidating and grotesque. It will chase its victim relentlessly, slashing and clawing at it, and sometimes calling bats to its aid in order to harass and disorient its prey. Anyone unfortunate enough to encounter a manbat should be swift-footed and well-armed.</p>  <p>Vicious Manbats have 1700 hitpoints. They are immune to death and earth damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against energy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Vicious Manbats yield 1200 experience points. They carry gold coins and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
