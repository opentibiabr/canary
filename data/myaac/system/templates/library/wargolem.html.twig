In our days, the remaining War Golems act as guards and bodyguards for high-ranking officials. Due to the high costs of their maintenance and the lack of staff required for repairs, War Golems are expensive and only seldom used, even if the problems of Yalahar are pressing.<br/>Created for war purposes, they utilise their golem abilities to the fullest. Heavily armored and enhanced with magic weaponry, the golems turn into behemoths of destruction. Only their simple-mindedness might be a weakness and hints that in former days the squads of War Golems were probably personally controlled by a Yalahari leader.<br/>War Golems are a rare sight. Most are stored away in the quarters of the Yalahari, a few are left and forgotten in abandoned areas of the city.<br/>Rumours persist that squads of War Golems were also deployed elsewhere in long forgotten wars. As they were never returned they are said to follow unknown orders of long dead commanders to the present day.</p>  <p>War Golems have 4300 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy, fire, holy, ice and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>War Golems yield 2750 experience points. They carry gold coins, ultimate health potions and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
