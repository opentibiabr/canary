They are highly responsive to the hive's wishes and can be found almost everywhere in the vicinity of the hive. As soon as a Waspoid encounters something tasty or threatening, it uses its powerful pheromones to call for reinforcements. So encountering a single Waspoid often means that all Hive Born in the area are on their way to assist the Waspoid in a few heartbeats. Therefore it should be killed as fast as possible. The Waspoid itself is, strangely enough, not truly aggressive. However, it displays a rude curiosity that involves stinging and biting of the encountered object which, despite its unaggressive intention, leads to a fight. The wings of the Waspoid are known to emit a highly annoying noise that can unnerve even the most stoic mammal. Insects, however, seem to be magically attracted by the noise and experiments seem to prove that the Waspoids are able to gain some kind of influence over insects that are not native to the hive. The experiments suggest that the Waspoids can control and lure foreign insects to the hive. Since it has been deemed as too dangerous to continue such experiments, they have been forbidden and it can only be speculated what the hive would 'do' to such formerly unaligned insects.<br/>In the battle against the Deeplings, the Waspoids are harassing opponents from unexpected angles, circumventing battle lines. They are an advance force that pierces the enemy's defence to disrupt the supply lines and reinforcements. Waspoids rather operate in small groups on their own than joining forces with other Hive Born. This way they can fully exploit their speed and their flight ability and so gain a considerable advantage for their army.</p>  <p>Waspoids have 1100 hitpoints. They are immune to earth damage. Moreover, they are strong against death and energy damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire, holy and physical damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Waspoids yield 830 experience points. They carry compound eyes, gold coins, platinum coins, waspoid claws, waspoid wings and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
