At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon and the victim regains its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.<br/>Werebadgers aren't very strong and tough but quick and clever in compensation. They are no real predators, but may nonetheless be a danger to the careless. Their appearance is a mix between a badger and a human being. Like badgers, Werebadgers favour caverns as homesteads.<br/>The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.</p>  <p>Werebadgers have 1700 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire, holy and ice damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Werebadgers yield 1600 experience points. They carry beetroots, gold coins, platinum coins, werebadger claws, werebadger skull and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
