At the beginning, the transformation only takes place at full moon, and the victim regains  its human appearance the next morning. In the course of time, the transformation lasts longer and the full moon is no longer a necessary condition for the transformation. At a certain point, the beast takes over more and more often.<br/>Werebears are strong and tough, yet a bit slow and clumsy. They are predators nonetheless, and their appearance is a mix between a bear and a human being. Like bears, Werebears favour caverns as homesteads and are not delighted with visitors.<br/>The curse of the Full Moon, as it is frequently called, is usually spread by the infectious bite or scratch of other were-creatures. Forbidden books also tell about methods that allow to turn somebody into a were-creature with the help of dark rites. Some twisted individuals even call the curse upon themselves in the hope of using their new powers to avenge an injustice or insult.</p>  <p>Werebears have 2400 hitpoints. They cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against death, earth, energy, ice and physical damage. On the other hand, they are weak against fire and holy damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced. In addition, they are able to sense invisible creatures.</p>  <p>Werebears yield 2100 experience points. They carry gold coins, ham, platinum coins, werebear fur, werebear skull and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
