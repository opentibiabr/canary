There are potions, spells and even apparatuses to raise the dead to serve their masters. While it is quite easy to raise a Zombie, it is more complicated to gain control. A good deal of aspiring zombie masters have died at the  rotting hands of a creature that was meant to become their minion.<br/>Zombies have hardly any intelligence. If they do not have somebody controlling them, they tend to follow primal instincts such as eating and hunting. The undead state makes Zombies resilient and quite strong. However, their process of decomposing never stops and so sooner or later, a Zombie turns into a skeleton, losing strength and resilience, but strangely enough, gaining some intelligence.<br/><br/>Sometimes the ingredients for zombiefication potions are set free in disadvantageous environments such as town wells through which the Zombie plague spreads like an infection. If this happens, whole towns are overrun by transformed Zombies that later haunt the surrounding area for months, or even years. For such incidents, all potential zombie masters are chased by the inquisition. In some years, the popularity to burn suspicious alchemists even outstripped the popularity of witch trials.</p>  <p>Zombies have 500 hitpoints. They are immune to death, earth, energy and ice damage and cannot be paralyzed. Moreover, they are strong against fire damage. These creatures can neither be summoned nor convinced.</p>  <p>Zombies yield 280 experience points. They carry brass helmets, gold coins, half-eaten brains and sometimes other items with them.</p>  </div></div>
